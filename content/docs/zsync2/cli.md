# CLI reference

Both binaries are built on top of [`cobra`](https://github.com/spf13/cobra),
so `--help` is always available and a `-h` short flag is wired up
everywhere.

## `gozsync`

```
gozsync reads a .zsync control file (locally or over HTTP), reuses any
blocks it can find in the given seed file, fetches the rest via HTTP
Range requests against the URL embedded in the .zsync, and writes the
reconstructed file. The on-the-wire format is byte-compatible with the
original zsync (Colin Phipps) and AppImageCommunity/zsync2.

Usage:
  gozsync [flags] <zsync-url-or-file>

Flags:
  -h, --help            help for gozsync
  -i, --input string    local seed file (older version of the target)
  -o, --output string   output path (default: Filename: from .zsync,
                        then basename of URL)
  -q, --quiet           suppress progress output
```

### Argument

`<zsync-url-or-file>` is required. May be:

- an `http://` or `https://` URL — `gozsync` fetches it
- a local path — `gozsync` reads the file directly

If it's a URL and the .zsync embeds relative `URL:` paths, those are
resolved against the *final* URL after HTTP redirects.

### Exit codes

| Code | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| 0 | Reconstruction succeeded; SHA-1 of output matches the .zsync header |
| 1 | Any other error (network, IO, hash mismatch, malformed .zsync) |

## `gozsyncmake`

```
gozsyncmake hashes the input file block-by-block (rolling weak
checksum + MD4) and writes a .zsync control file that a zsync client
can later use to reconstruct the input on a target machine while
re-using as many shared blocks as possible from a seed file.

Usage:
  gozsyncmake [flags] <input>

Flags:
  -b, --blocksize int     block size in bytes; must be a power of two
                          (default: auto)
  -f, --filename string   target filename to embed in the .zsync
                          (default: basename of input)
  -h, --help              help for gozsyncmake
  -o, --output string     output .zsync filename (default: <input>.zsync)
  -u, --url stringArray   URL the client should fetch the target from
                          (may be repeated)
```

### Block size

When `--blocksize` is `0` (default), `gozsyncmake` picks the same value
the C reference picks: a power of two between 1024 and 32768, sized so
the resulting weak-checksum table has ~10 bits of overhead per block.
Bigger blocks → smaller `.zsync` but coarser change detection.

### URLs

Pass one or more `--url` to embed in the `.zsync`. The client picks the
first one that works (multi-URL failover is not implemented in MVP, but
the format is preserved).

If no `--url` is given, `gozsyncmake` embeds `basename(<input>)` as a
relative URL — useful if you serve the `.zsync` and the target from the
same directory.
